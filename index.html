<h1>David Dorward's public code repositories</h1>
<p>You may (but probably won't) be interested in:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dorward/simple-ajax-demo">a tiny Ajax demo</a> I pull out from time to time to explain the concepts involved.</p>

<p>A couple of attempts to build a CMS to replace the hidiously ugly sBuilder
that I wrote when I first learned about DBIx::Class: <a href="https://github.com/dorward/axford">axford</a> is a reasonably straight port of sBuilder to Catalyst, while <a href="https://github.com/dorward/sprue">sprue</a> try to solve the problem from scratch using CouchDB. Neither are production ready.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fleetfootmike/wargamers-pledge">Wargamers Pledge</a> is a system for tracking miniatures.</p>

<p>Most of these are fairly early in development; I spend most of my programming energies on work I get paid for which leaves little for these projects.</p>
